					<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
					<p>In this tutorial, you will learn about Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML.</p>
					<p>Webpages are created using HTML, which is an authoring language used to create documents for the web. HTML consists of a set of special instructions called tags to define the structure and layout of content in a webpage. A browser reads the HTML tags to determine how to display the webpage content on a screen.</p>

					<h3>Your First Webpage</h3>
					<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to create your first webpage.</p>
					<p>You can create webpages using HTML with a simple text editor, such as Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime, Programmer's Notepad, TextEdit, and TextWrangler. Notepad comes preinstalled with the Windows operating system and TextEdit comes preinstalled with the Mac OS X, while the other text editors run on Windows. A text editor is a program that allows you to enter, change, save, and print text, which includes HTML tags.</p>
